# ML-Computing-at-Scale
problem_1_1.sh: A shell script that implements Linux command-line tasks, such as downloading files, filtering data, and sorting based on specific conditions.

problem_1_2a.py: Python code for a Monte Carlo simulation of Ï€, with a focus on identifying serial and parallel portions of the code and measuring time for each.

problem_1_2b.py: Implements an efficient multiprocessing solution for the Monte Carlo simulation and generates a speedup plot to compare theoretical vs. actual performance scaling.

problem_1_2c.py: Extends the Monte Carlo simulation to make the runs repeatable using an explicit random seed.
